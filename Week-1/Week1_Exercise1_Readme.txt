What is a Web Browser?

A web browser is a software application that lets people access the World Wide Web. It is used to locate, fetch and display content on the internet, including web pages, images, videos, documents, and other files. In other words, you can also call it a rendering engine whose job is to download a web page and render it in a way thatâ€™s understandable by people. Web pages are built upon HTML, which needs to be rendered in the layout displayed in the user interface.

Components of a Web Browser:

1. User Interface
The interface is the space where you interact with the browser. It includes the address bar, on-screen controls like home, back, forward, and refresh, followed by the part where the web page is displayed, bookmarks button, and all other options on the browser screen.

2. Browser Engine
The Browser Engine provides a link between the user interface and the rendering engine. It manages and manipulates the rendering engine based on inputs from various user interfaces.

3. Rendering Engine
The Rendering Engine renders the requested web page on the browser screen. A web page is a document commonly written in HTML- rendering engine converts this document and data to an understandable format so that users can see the desired site, image, or video.

4. Networking
The Networking component handles internet communication and security. It retrieves the URLs using common internet protocols like HTML and FTP.

5. JavaScript Interpreter
The JavaScript Interpreter, as the name suggests, interprets and executes the JavaScript code embedded in a website. The results then are sent to the rendering engine for display.

6. UI Backend
UI Backend helps to draw basic widgets like a select box, an input box, a window, a check box, etc. It uses the underlying operating system user interface methods for the same.

7. Data Storage
It is a uniform layer that the browser uses to store all its data including Cookies, Local Storage, Session Storage, IndexedDB, WebSQL, and FileSystem.

Step-by-Step Working of Browser:

Whenever you click on a link or enter a URL, the browser sends and receives information or data to and from other parts of the web. The information it receives is rendered by the rendering engine and translated into an easily understandable format. It is then displayed in the user interface. It involves a multi-step process including DNS resolution, HTTP exchange between browser and web server, rendering, and so on, as follows:

-You enter a URL in the web browser.
-The browser finds the IP address for the domain using DNS.
-The browser initiates a connection with the server.
-Next, it sends an HTTP request to the webserver.
-The server handles the request and sends out an HTTP response.
-The browser renders and displays the HTML content, i.e., the web page.
